How to assemble the 3D printed magnetic breakaway for the BusKill cable.


Steps
-----
1. **Prepare the 3D Printed Parts**:
   - Get the .scad files from the repo, generate your STLs, and slice the file.

2. **Insert the Magnets**:
   - Place the magnets in the designated slots in the 3D printed parts.
   - Ensure the polarity of the magnets is correct to allow them to attract each other.

3. **Solder the Pogo Pins and Contacts**:
   - Solder Pogo Pins to the 28 AWG wire.
   - Solder Pogo Contacts to the 28 awg wire.

4. **Secure the Magnets**:
   - Apply a small amount of super glue to secure the magnets in place.
   - Allow the glue to dry completely.

5. **Assemble the Parts**:
   - Align the 3D printed parts and assemble them together.
   - Use screws to secure the parts together.

6. **Attach the Cable**:
   - Insert the cable into the appropriate slot in the 3D printed assembly.
   - Secure the cable in place using additional screws if necessary.

7. **Test the Assembly**:
   - Verify that the magnetic release mechanism works correctly by connecting and disconnecting the cable.
   - Ensure that the connection is secure and that the cable releases properly when pulled.
